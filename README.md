# Robot Framework Project

## Description
This repository contains test automation scripts built using **Robot Framework**, an open-source automation tool for acceptance testing and robotic process automation (RPA). The project is designed to [briefly state the purpose, e.g., test a web application, API automation, or RPA tasks].

---

## Features
- Comprehensive test cases for [specific functionality or application].
- Modular and reusable keyword-driven test structure.
- Integration with [tools like Selenium, REST library, etc.].
- Supports data-driven and cross-browser testing.

---

- Python (>= 3.x)
- Robot Framework (>= 4.x)
- Required libraries:
  - SeleniumLibrary (for web automation)
  - RequestsLibrary (for API testing)
  - Other dependencies as needed

Install the required libraries using pip:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
